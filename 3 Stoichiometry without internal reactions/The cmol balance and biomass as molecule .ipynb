    "When considering the elemental composition of biomass it is important to realise that the elements of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the main constituents. A typical *E. coli* cell has the following mass based distribution of the main building blocks: proteins (55%), RNA (20%), Lipids (10%) and DNA (4%). From chapter 1 the chemical composition of these building blocks are well established and by merely looking at the structures of these chemicals it should be evident that carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are the main atoms in these molecules. Elements like phosphor and sulphur will also feature but to an lesser extent. In addition numerous other elements are present in minute quantities and although the amounts are small they are all essential to life.\n",

    "The chemical engineer has a mass balance orientated approach and accordingly only the major elemental constituents (C H O and N) will be considered.

    "We will assume that all the micro nutrients are present in the liquid medium. Note that biomass is an net product but that nothing will be possible if biomass does not act as reagent. One requires biomass to make more biomass. The carbon source will contain the majority of the carbon that will end up as either biomass or catabolites. The carbon source will also contain the required oxygen and hydrogen atoms, just think of the chemical formula for glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$). The nitrogen source can either be defined or complex. A defined nitrogen source will be something like ammonia or urea where the chemical composition is known. We’ll mostly use these nitrogen sources in our calculations. Complex nitrogen sources entails the use of cell building blocks like amino acids or peptides that originated from a growing organism. An example is yeast extract where dissolvable parts of disrupted (opened) yeast cells are used as nitrogen feed in a fermentation. Some organisms cannot synthesise all their required amino acids from inorganic nitrogen (see auxotrophy) and requires a complex nitrogen feed. \n",

We will effectively reduce all carbon containing molecules to only having a single carbon atom. To understand the cmol method of performing elemental balances we’ll start by redoing the succinic acid example of the previous section.

The difference between cmols and mols will be the number of carbon atoms in the carbon containing molecule. In this formulation the molecules are redefined as single carbon molecules containing the averaged oxygen and hydrogen counterparts.
