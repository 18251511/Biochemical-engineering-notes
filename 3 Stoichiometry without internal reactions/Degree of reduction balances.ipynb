    "## The degree of reduction method for balancing equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of reduction (DOR) method uses set oxidation states of carbon ($+4$), hydrogen ($+1$), oxygen ($-2$) and nitrogen ($-3$) to perform the hydrogen and oxygen balances in a single balance by excluding water. Instead of having the normal 4 balances ($C,H,O$ and $N$) we end up with a $C$, $DOR$ and $N$ balance where the water yield coefficient is ignored. We thus end up with one less equation but also with one less yield coefficient. It can be considered as a shortcut and alternative method for calculating yield coefficients. The $DOR$ balance is similar to the $NADH$ balance that we will perform in chapter 4.\n",
