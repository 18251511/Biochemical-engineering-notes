      "## 5.6 Aerobic systems\n",
      "\n",
      "When oxygen is available, the carbon substrate can be converted to more energy than in anaerobic systems. With a full TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation the energy gained from the carbon substrate is an order of magnitude more than when only substrate level phosphorylation occurs. For aerobic systems CO2 and H20 will be the main catabolites, where the carbon backbone of the substrate (glucose) is completely disintegrated. This stands in contrast with anaerobic systems where sections of the carbon backbone is excreted from the cell and regularly used as commercial chemicals. Lactic acid, ethanol and acetic acid will be a prime example of this. This begs the question whether aerobic systems can be useful for producing chemicals, since CO2 is not a wanted commercial product. For some scenarios the biomass itself is the targeted product, like in the production of baker\u2019s yeast and this justifies the use of oxygen in a commercial process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most commercial fermentation processes employ aerobes where oxygen is sparged through the bioreactor. In all of these systems a major part of the carbon flux is directed to molecules with carbon skeleton. Examples of these include organic acids like citric and malic acid, alcohols like propane diol, amino acids like glutamate and lysine, proteins like insulin and cellulase and various other commercial chemicals. These biochemicals cannot be seen as catabolites, since ATP was not generated in its production, but rather consumed. One might look at some of these molecules as anabolites, but the fact that these molecules are excreted and not directly used for making new biomass also disqualifies the anabolite notion. So why do these molecules get produced by microbes?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to the question lies in the organism\u2019s interaction with its environment and fellow competitors. In most scenarios the excreted product performs an extracellular function that favours the survival of the organism. For example, extracellular fungal enzymes or exoenzymes are used to break complex macromolecules like cellulose into digestible glucose units. The enzymes are thus used to prepare the food to the organism on the outside. Another example is the excretion of organic acids by some fungi. This creates a low pH environment that the organism is more adapted to and hence it has a growth advantage over other competing organisms. The biochemical engineer are typically more interested in utilising the cellular excretions than understanding its origins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the metabolism of these organism entail, oxygen is used to generate ATP in an efficient manner. It also \u2018digest\u2019 excess NADH formed in some of these processes. In order to model the metabolic flux distributions of these systems, oxidative phosphorylation need to be included into the flux model. This can be done by defining a molar oxygen flux.\n",

      "We will now return to the _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ example (tut 2) where biomass production is considered. The full TCA flux model will be performed for this example. This will be helpful for constructing models where TCA intermediates (or metabolites a few enzymatic steps away from a TCA intermediate) are considered as excretion products. It will be shown that the TCA cycle can be reduced to a simpler flux model if complete respiration is the only objective.\n",
