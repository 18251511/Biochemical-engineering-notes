    "## Sugar addicted *Rhizopus oryzae*\n",
    "### by Eleanor Reynecke\n",
    "\n",
    "*Rhizopus oryzae*, referred to as *Rhozy* in our lab is an interesting soil fungus that produces fumaric acid under the correct conditions. *Rhozy* consumes glucose at a fixed maximum rate independent of the conditions in the fermenter. When *Rhozy* runs out of a nitrogen source biomass production is not possible, but this does not not stop the fungus from consuming glucose at the maximum possible uptake rate. In this tut we will be looking at the mechanisms that this clever organism uses to process all the consumed glucose. We will look at special transporter proteins in the cell membrane that excretes fumaric acid by using some of the internally generated ATP. You will be expected to set up the flux model by yourself and also incorporate the nitrogen source as an additional substrate. The metabolic flux diagram is given below:\n",

    "<img src=\"RhozyMap.png\" width=\"500\" />\n",

    "We have recently established in our own lab that *Rhozy* is Crabtree positive, just like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. You have to accordingly take note of the maximum allowable flux to $r_5$.\n"
