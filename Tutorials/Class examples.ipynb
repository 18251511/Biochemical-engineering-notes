    "Ben (100 kg) has an average daily energy output of 0.3 $\\frac{W}{kg}$. Ben represents the average human who are able to convert 25% of his energy intake to energy output under normal respiration conditions. Let's assume that Ben lives on only drinking Coke. Assume that sugar contains 17 $\\frac{kJ}{g}$. Use glucose for all sugar. Assume a $(P/O)_{NADH}$ of 1.5 and a $(P/O)_{FADH}$ of 1. \n",
