    "## Facultative anaerobes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organisms like lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are able to survive under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This implies that energy (ATP) can be generated form respiration (oxidative phosphorylation) or substrate level phosphorylation (ATP generation from the fermentative pathways). In the previous [section](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/willienicol/Biochemical-engineering-notes/blob/master/6%20Modeling%20stoichiometry%20variations/Oxygen%20starvation%20in%20batch%20fermenters.ipynb) we have seen how growth is slow down by an oxygen limitation. In the example in this section the microbe has an alternative pathway to generate ATP (anaerobic) that can be used when the oxygen supply is limited. The microbe will thus attempt to maintain its growth rate ($\\mu$ factory) by generating the ATP without using oxygen. More detail is provided in the video.\n",
