    "The production of 1,3 propanediol (PDO) by the company DuPont is one of the success stories of bioproduction of polymer intermediates on a bulk scale. Read on the polymer [SORONA](http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/fibers/brands/dupont-sorona/articles/how-dupont-sorona-is-made.html) for some background on the process and final product.\n",

    "PDO is a natural metabolic product when _Klebsiella pneumonica_ grows on glycerol as substrate. DuPont opted for glucose as feedstock and engineered _Escherichia coli_ to aerobically convert glucose into PDO.\n",
    "\n",
    "A batch fermentation was performed where 160 g/L of glucose was converted in 72 hours. The batch fermenter is equipped with an off-gas analyser of the sparged air where $O_2$ and $CO_2$ is analysed. It was determined that 55 liter of O2 was consumed while 190 liters of CO2 was produced during the fermentation run. The run was performed at sea level using a 5 liter fermenter/bioreactor. Off-gas was analysed at 25C. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall reaction utilises glucose, ammonia and oxygen as feed. Assume that apart from PDO and biomass, no by-products are formed except water and $CO_2$. It is further given that the _E.coli_ can be described by $CH_{1.91}O_{0.48}N_{0.22}$. \n",
