    "In this tutorial you will be given a taste of what it is like to be a bioengineer. The organism that you will be working with is *Rhizopus oryzae*. This organism is particularly interesting since it excretes fumaric acid in higher concentration than any other organism, natural or genetically modified. However it doesn't come without its problems. It has been found to be a Crabtree positive organism, meaning that it has a limited respiration potential and produces ethanol under fully aerobic conditions as a result. *R. oryzae* is heavily influenced by the concentration of nitrogen in the media. Nitrogen is essential for the production of biomass but fumaric acid is inhibited by the presence of nitrogen."

    "For this tutorial you will not have access to the responce function and the parameters such as µ, Θ or Km$_S$ will not be given. You will be finding these parameters through analysing the fermentations concentration profiles. However α and γ are given as $0.1~mol~Cmol_X^{-1}$ and $2.5~mol_{ATP}~Cmol_X^{-1}$. The flux model is given below. When looking at the production of fumaric acid there is an additional cost of 3 moles per mole of fumaric acid not shown on the fulc model. (Important for the ATP balance) This is as a result of the cost of exproting the molecule out of the cell and into the broth."

In order to import and use the function please see the cose below. The function is coded as a fed-batch fermenter, so for the first part of the tutorial set Q = 0 and all the feed concentrations to zero, as this will simulate a batch process. Pressing Shift + Tab next to the ferm function will give you more info on the function and what the varibales are."

    "k) Now that the biomass has been grown the fermenter is washed to remove the metabolites and any trace of nitrogen that would inhibit fumaric acid production. This is now the fumaric acid production phase of the fermentation. The biomass concentration does not change as the biomass is immobilised in the fermenter.
