    "## 4.7 NADH and ATP balances\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to understand that any cell maintains a redox and energy balance. In simple terms one can say that all NADH produced needs to be consumed (redox balance) while the exact same apply for ATP (energy balance). For purposes of simplicity we’ll refer to all the electron carriers (NADH, NADPH and FADH<sub>2</sub>) as NADH and all the energy carriers (GTP, ATP) as ATP. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our course we will clearly distinguish between the catabolism and the anabolism. Catabolism entails the breakdown of a carbon source with the main purpose of generating energy in the form of ATP. Anabolism entails the synthesis of biochemical building blocks to produce and maintain biomass. The amount of biochemical reactions of the anabolism far outweighs the amount of catabolic reactions. Accordingly we will only model the catabolic reactions, while an overall and lumped equation will be used to model the anabolism. We have already discussed this equation in section 4.6. In this section (and in this section only) we’ll also lump the catabolism into a single overall expression. The idea is to show the ‘half reactions’ of the overall ‘black box’ equation that describes the process.\n",

    "The figure illustrates that the ATP consumed by the anabolism must be the same as the ATP produced by the catabolism. In a similar manner the NADH produced by the anabolism must be consumed by the catabolism. It has to be said however that the NADH produced by the anabolism is very small and in some cases almost negligible. In this section we’ll choose our values so that the $β$ value is zero, thus no NADH production in the anabolism. In chapter 5 we’ll show how positive $β$ values can be incorporated into the NADH balance. Given negligible NADH production in the anabolism, the implication is that NADH should be balanced in the catabolism. This is in agreement with the videos we have seen on ethanol and lactic acid fermentation. Remember these diagrams?\n",
